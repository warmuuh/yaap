To create a local copy of the source using rvs_get, first download it and make it executable, then point it at the project root as shown below.

It looks for a project_files file in the directory you point it at, and then downloads the files listed there.

It will create a local PanPG directory (or another directory if you pass the name as the second argument).
It will complain and exit if that directory already exists.
So you can use this to download the current tree, but it won't overwrite an existing tree, and any merging with your own local modifications you'll have to do yourself.

wget http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get
chmod +x rvs_get
./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/

Or in one line:

curl -sS http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/revstore/rvs_get | sh -s http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/

By pointing it at the development directory you will get the latest code.
You can also download the v0.0.6 release instead, with:

./rvs_get http://boshi.inimino.org/3box-asof/1282000000000/PanPG/
