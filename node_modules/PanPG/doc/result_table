Documenting the result table representation maintained by the v5 generated parsers.
This is an internal detail and shouldn't be relevant for users of the API.

Summary
-------

tbl[<start position in input>][<rule index>] = either
- undefined (the rule has not been tried at that position)
- [true,<end position>,<children>] (the rule matched)
- false (the rule failed at this position)

<children> is an array of zero or more arrays of the form [<pos>,<rule index>] which can be used to look up the children of a node in the result table.

Details
-------

The result table is an array of arrays.
It is indexed first by position in the input, in code units.
This array is then indexed by rule name index.
Thus a parse result for the start rule, with index 0, at position 0, will always be recorded at tbl[0][0] (unless the start rule has a different index), while the next result might be a sequence of matched rules all at tbl[0][n], and perhaps a string of failure results on tbl[3][n], indicating all the rules that failed to match there.

From the result table much of the history of a parse can be reconstructed, which makes them useful for debugging and for generating error messages.

At each tbl[pos][rule] position in the table, there will be either nothing if that rule was never tried at that position, or a success or failure result.
A success result recorded as an array [true,<end position>,<children>], and a failure result as Boolean `false`.
The end position is the position in the input string at which the match ended.
The position at which it began is already known, being given by the position in the result table.
Having the end position allows the parser to jump immediately to the end of the match on a positive cache hit.
The array of children is given as an array of [<pos>,<rule>] elements.
The position and rule index can then be used to look up the child node result in the table (which will always be a successful result) to recursively construct a parse tree from the result table.
Generated parsers perform this step once a parse succeeds and return the tree, discarding the result table.
