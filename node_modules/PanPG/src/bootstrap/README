Originally there was a bootstrapping process starting from pure JavaScript and working up to the full PEG parser generator.
This is the remnants of that system.
Currently this is unmaintained but it may be revived in a more elegant form at some future point.

The current builds require build/parsePEG.js to exist in order to rebuild build/parsePEG.js itself or any other parser.
